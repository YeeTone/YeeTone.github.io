I maintained the JCoder OJ with Xuqun LIU, Yansong HUANG and Shengqi LIU in 2022 Fall semester. 
This OJ was used to judge CS107/CS109, CS112, CS202, CS203, CS209A and CS307 Assignments.

Here is the repository for the JCoder OJ maintenance: https://github.com/JCoder-Pro.

This OJ serves about 4,000 students in 2022 fall semester.
